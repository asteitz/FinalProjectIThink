I worked to integrate fire store into my project and was able to create a database. I designed a sign-in page and 
sidebar that pops out and allows you to navigate through the pages.

My app allows you to sign in and then you can access the first page. Then you can look at a restaurant and the items in it!



 
To begin I integrated a fire-store database to handle the user data. I used a recycler view to store the restaurants and display them on the main reminder page (screen)
and it allows users to scroll and view all reminders without fear of losing the content when it goes off the page!
<br>
<br>
The app opens and has a sign-in screen that pops up and has a user sign in. 
<br>
After the user enters all fields, they can press the escape button which takes them to the main screen and they can delete or add notes as they please
<br>
<br>
Then the sidebar is used to navigate to other screens like recent orders! 


## Functionality
'*' indicates tested in GIF  
The following **required** functionality is completed:
<br>
* signing in to the app
* brought to the home screen
* goes to recent orders

This is viewable in the following video:
